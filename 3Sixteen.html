                3sixteen is a New York-based brand recognized for its commitment to crafting high-quality, American-made raw denim and minimalist menswear. Founded in 2003 by Andrew Chen and Johan Lam, the brand originally focused on streetwear but made a significant transition around 2008, honing in on premium denim. This shift was motivated by their desire to create durable, long-lasting clothing that evolves with wear, reflecting the brand's philosophy of timeless style and craftsmanship.

                The brand is particularly renowned for its expertise in raw selvedge denim, which is untreated and designed to develop unique fades over time based on the wearer’s lifestyle and habits. This process allows each pair of jeans to tell a personalized story, making it highly sought after by denim enthusiasts. 3sixteen sources much of its denim from the famed Kuroki Mills in Japan, known for its superior fabric quality and traditional production methods. The denim’s durability and slow break-in period are key traits, offering customers a product that improves with time and wear.
