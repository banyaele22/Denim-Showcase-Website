                Iron Heart is a Japanese denim brand renowned for producing ultra-heavyweight denim and workwear with a focus on durability, quality, and craftsmanship. Founded by Shinichi Haraki in 2003, the brand initially targeted motorcycle enthusiasts who needed robust clothing that could withstand tough conditions. Iron Heart jeans are made using heavyweight denim, often ranging from 16 oz to 25 oz, significantly thicker than standard jeans, making them highly durable and long-lasting.

Iron Heart is known for its meticulous attention to detail, with all production taking place in Japan. The denim is typically woven on vintage shuttle looms, giving the fabric a distinct selvage edge and a rich texture that fades beautifully over time. The brand offers a variety of fits, from slim to relaxed, and is particularly loved for its heavyweight fabrics, which appeal to denim enthusiasts and those who appreciate rugged, high-quality craftsmanship.

The brand has built a cult following due to its commitment to producing long-lasting, timeless pieces, combining classic Americana workwear with Japanese precision. Along with jeans, Iron Heart also produces shirts, jackets, and accessories, all designed with durability and style in mind.
