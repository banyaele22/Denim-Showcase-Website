        <p class = "NakedFamous-description">Founded by Brandon Svarc in 2008, his family has worked within the garment industry for more than 65 years. He decided to create his own brand and cultivated it to focus more on raw denim. His overall philosophy on the brand was to be known for its craftsmanship instead of the people who wear it in which you can see this philosophy personified in the brands sublabel, "Unbranded Brand".</p>
